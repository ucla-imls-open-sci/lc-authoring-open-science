## Overview of Scholarly Publishing

Researchers in all disciplines are often told to “publish or perish”, meaning that they must write articles about their research and get them printed in acceptable publications or risk losing out on opportunities. If you think this instruction to “publish” is vague, then you’re on the right track. What does it mean to publish or be published? What is an “acceptable” publication? That usually depends on the POV of three groups (1) research/academic institutions (2) funders (3) publishers. 

Fortunately, there is always a great xckd comic for everything, and even better contextual information on the explain xkcd wiki.

## OPTIONAL Exercise: Jargon Busting

Adapted from Library Carpentry: Have learners identify and explain publishing-related jargon in groups, then share out.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Conflicting Policies
Dr. Jay publishes in a hybrid journal that delays repository access beyond their funder's requirements. They must renegotiate or change journals.

### Case Study 2: Aligned Incentives
Dr. Ripken publishes in a fully open platform supported by institutional partnerships and funder mandates.

### Case Study 3: No Open Science Incentives
Dr. Brown chooses a closed journal based on personal networks and convenience, without considering long-term openness or access.

::::: discussion

## Discussion Exercise

- What could Dr. Jay have done differently at the project planning stage?
- If Dr. Ripken’s journal fees were too high, what would be their next step?
- Should Dr. Brown’s team explore more open options?
:::::: 


## Choosing a Publication Venue
- Use [Think. Check. Submit.](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) to assess journal credibility
- Check funder and institutional policies
- Evaluate a journal’s open science stance beyond JIFs

## Publishing Workflows

**Traditional Workflow**  
*Researchers → Peer Review → Edits → Publication → Library Access*

**Open Science Workflow**  
*Researchers → Preprints → Community Feedback → Submission → Open Peer Review → Open Access Publication*

## Exercise: Quiz – Traditional vs. Open Science Publishing
(T/F statements provided in source doc)

## Exercise: Journal Evaluation
Groups evaluate journals for openness using:
- Code4Lib Journal
- Practical Academic Librarianship
- International Journal on Digital Libraries

## Key Points
- Understand the institutional, funder, and publisher influences on publishing choices
- Assess publication venues critically for openness and accessibility
- Open science values can be embedded in authoring, publishing, and reviewing choices
