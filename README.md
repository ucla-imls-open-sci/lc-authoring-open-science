## Lesson Description

The values proclaimed by open science—trust, transparency, and reproducibility—are most visible during the outputs stage of the research lifecycle. Creating open and transparent outputs is a requirement for reproducible research. Librarians can support researchers in creating these open outputs through education, outreach, technical troubleshooting, and review. This lesson expands upon work done by Caltech Library in their Author Carpentry lessons to focus on how open science values can be integrated into the processes for authoring and reviewing research outputs.

First, we summarize how the writing process can change once open science values are introduced. Then we answer the question “What can I use instead of Microsoft Word?” by introducing tools that use formats such as Markdown and LaTeX for writing and RIS and BibTeX for references. The lesson shows how these tools integrate into versioning systems (e.g., git/GitHub) for a fully open and collaborative authoring workflow. 

We then explore the importance of full transparency in selecting authors and disclosing conflicts of interest. The CRediT taxonomy and best practices for disclosure are covered, followed by an introduction to open peer review: its benefits, ethics, definitions, and platforms that support it. The lesson concludes by connecting open science to DEIA principles.
