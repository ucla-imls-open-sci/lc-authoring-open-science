Open Peer Review (OPR) reflects Open Science principles such as transparency, collegiality, and inclusivity. In OPR, reviewers' names and/or their reports are made public. Sometimes, articles allow reader comments post-publication.

## A Brief History of Open Peer Review

While modern peer review became formalized in the 20th century, signed and public reviews date back to Enlightenment-era scholarly correspondence. The *Journal of Medical Internet Research* introduced OPR in 1999, and since then, practices have diversified.

## Challenge: True or False?

Indicate whether each statement is true or false.

1. Peer review exists on a spectrum from closed to open.  
2. Open Participation means no pre-publication review occurred.  
3. Open Reports mean authors must incorporate all feedback.

## Solutions

1. ✅ True – Peer review practices vary.
2. ❌ False – Open Participation allows comments post-publication but doesn’t exclude pre-publication review.
3. ❌ False – Open Reports only require that feedback is published, not implemented.

## Common Arguments Against Open Review

| Concern | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Signed reviews deter participation | Early resistance has faded as norms change. |
| Bias in reviewing known authors | May introduce bias; mitigated with optional anonymity. |
| Editors already serve this function | Editors retain final decision authority regardless of review format. |

> “Editors take responsibility for decisions and the advice informing them.” – [Nature Editorial](https://doi.org/10.1038/6295)

## Ethical Considerations

- **Power dynamics**: Seniority, gender, institutional prestige.
- **Peer pressure**: Fear of backlash when reviews are public.

## Toward Equitable Review

Rather than aiming for maximum openness, aim for **equitable peer review**:

- Keep author anonymity optional.
- Let reviewers choose whether to sign.
- Encourage transparent reports and public comments.
- Adapt practices to context, reducing harm from bias or power imbalance.
