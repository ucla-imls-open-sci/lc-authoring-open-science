## Overview of Scholarly Publishing

Researchers in all disciplines are often told to “publish or perish”, meaning that they must write 
articles about their research and get them printed in acceptable publications or risk losing out on opportunities. 
If you think this instruction to “publish” is vague, then you’re on the right track. 
What does it mean to publish or be published? What is an “acceptable” publication? 
That usually depends on the POV of three groups (1) research/academic institutions (2) funders (3) publishers. 

Fortunately, there is always a great xckd comic for everything, and even better contextual information on the explain xkcd wiki. 

:::: discussion
Let’s look at the below comics and the explanations together and then discuss.

:::: instructor

Read through the explanations for each comic and point out how researchers have to answer to 3 groups: 
1. research/academic institutions: employer of a researcher; can also be a funder 
1. funders: provides funding to research projects; can also be a research institution
1. publishers: disseminates research

## OPTIONAL Exercise: Jargon Busting

This exercise is an opportunity to gain a firmer grasp on the concepts around scholarly publishing and open science.

1. Form groups of four to six and choose a note-taker.
2. Talk for three minutes (your instructor will be timing you!) on any terms, phrases, or ideas around publishing or open science that you’ve come across and perhaps feel you should know better.
3. Make a list of all the problematic terms, phrases, and ideas. Note if more than one person finds a term problematic.
4. Identify common problematic words as a starting point - spend 10 minutes working together to try to explain what the terms, phrases, or ideas on your list mean. Note: use both each other and the internet as a resource.
5. Identify the terms your groups were able to explain as well as those you are still struggling with.
6. Each group then reports back on one issue resolved by their group and one issue not resolved by their group.
7. The instructor will collate these on a whiteboard or shared document and facilitate a discussion about what we will cover today and where you can go for help on those things we won’t cover. Any jargon or terms that will not be covered specifically are good notes.

## Case Studies

:::::: instructor

Have learners put up a sticky note when they’re done reading each case study

::::::::::

### Case Study 1: Conflicting Policies

Dr. Jay received funding from the **National Beneficiary Advancement Agency (NBA)** for their project. 
Dr. Jay’s employer, **Pinehurst Hall Institute (PHI)**, grants promotions based on the number of 
articles in “top tier” journals (with an impact factor >10).

The NBA requires all articles resulting from funding to be:

1. Published in a journal in their catalog, and  
2. Publicly available in their repository no later than **12 months** after publication.

Dr. Jay found *The Journal of Hoops and Performance (Hoops)*, published by **CourtVision Press**, 
which meets PHI’s standards and is listed in the NBA’s catalog.

Upon submission, Dr. Jay discovers that *Hoops* is a **hybrid journal**that publishes some 
articles behind a subscription paywall, and others are made public or ‘open access’ if authors pay $3,050.

Dr. Jay has no more funding from the NBA or PHI, so opts to publish the article in the non-open access portion of *Hoops*.

However, after acceptance, CourtVision Press notifies Dr. Jay that the article **cannot be deposited 
in the NBA’s repository until 24 months** after publication, **violating the NBA’s 12-month rule**.

As a result, Dr. Jay must pause their research project to negotiate with the publisher and the NBA, 
or find a different journal altogether.

![Diagram illustrating the conflicting requirements faced by Dr. Jay: institutional promotion criteria, funder open access policy, and publisher embargo limits.](fig/casestudy1.png)

From this example, we can see that Dr. Jay is trying to meet the requirements of multiple groups with different values. 
Their employer wants to show their stakeholders high productivity and impact. The funder wants to comply with federal mandates. The publisher wants to maintain control over dissemination. 

### Case Study 2: Aligned Incentives
Dr. Ripken received funding from the Municipal Leadership and Bridges Program (MLB) for their project. Dr. Ripken’s 
employer, Biogen Advanced Labs (BAL), has signaled that recognition will be awarded to projects that show 
commitment to Open Science. The MLB requires all peer-reviewed articles to have: 

1. persistent identifiers (PIDs) to be included in acknowledgments and/or funding statements, and 
1. a plan for posting publicly within 12 months of publication. 

Dr. Ripken has found Diamond Press Publishing, whose catalog of journals have a platform that allow them to share 
all iterations of the research project: study protocols, preprints, datasets, peer review history and final article. 
Dr. Ripken has to pay fees to ensure all of these outputs are open, but is happy to discover that their BAL has a 
partnership with Diamond Press Publishing that offsets some of the costs, and the rest are covered in the original 
contract with the MLB.

### Case Study 3: No Open Science Incentives

Dr. Brown is working with Drs. O’Connell and Carpenter all employed by the Center for Life Sciences and Virology (CLV). 
They received internal funding for their research project. The CLV only requires a list of publications as a result 
of the funding and has no public access or open science policies, and has not included funding for publication in the 
contract. Dr. Brown tells their team that they should publish in Gridiron Journal because they know the editor-in-chief. 
Gridiron Journal is ‘hybrid’, meaning that Drs. Brown, O’Connell, and Carpenter can:

1. pay $1075 to make their article publicly available, or
2. pay nothing and it can only be accessed by readers with a subscription. 

They decide to go with option 2.

::::: discussion


1. How could Dr. Jay have avoided the situation during the project planning / funding request stage?
1. What if Dr. Ripken discovered the publisher’s fees were over budget? What would his first strategy be?
1. Should Dr. Brown’s research team explore other publishing options? Why do you think they chose the path in the case study?

## Choosing a Publication Venue
Since so many journals are shifting to open access models, it’s important to 
ensure the journal is still a fit for all your research needs. 

First you want to make sure the journal is credible and legitimate. <https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/>

Second, if you have received funding for the research for which you’re writing an article,  you want to check the 
agreements for publishing requirements. Also check your affiliated institution’s requirements for publishing. 
And third, check the editorial and access policies for the journal you want to submit to. These three parties need 
to work together to successfully publish your article.

If there are no external requirements for where to publish, it’s important to understand how a journal or its 
publisher values open access and open science. For example, if a journal does not have a policy on making publishable 
data available with the manuscript. Choosing a publication based on impact factors or citation data is not getting 
the full picture. Journal impact factors were originally designed to help libraries purchase journals, and have 
subsequently been used to choose where to publish and to evaluate individual researcher’s impact on their profession:

## The writing and submission process

How authors write and submit the manuscript depends on where they’ve chosen to publish.

Understanding the difference between traditional and open science publishing is important here.


### Traditional Workflow

![Traditional Workflow](fig/schol-com-traditional.png)
*Researchers → Peer Review → Edits → Publication → Library Access*

### Open Science Workflow

![Open Science Workflow](fig/open-sci-publishing.png)

*Researchers → Preprints → Community Feedback → Submission → Open Peer Review → Open Access Publication*

While some journals still operate under the ‘traditional’ model, many are moving to open access or ‘hybrid’ states where researchers get to choose. It’s important for researchers to collaborate early and often on how their work will be made available.

## Exercise: Quiz – Traditional vs. Open Science Publishing

1. T/F: Authors can post their article online before submitting to a peer-reviewed journal 
1. T/F: Authors should choose where to publish their articles based on Journal Impact Factors
1. T/F: Authors should submit articles by emailing the editorial board 
1. T/F: Authors should consult colleagues, library staff, and other available resources when choosing where to publish their article 
1. T/F: All scholarly publications are committed to open science 

::::: solution
1. F, must check journal’s preprint policy
1. F, JIFs were originally meant to help libraries decide what journals to purchase, not where authors should publish
1. F, always check the journal’s policies and processes before submitting
1. T, don’t rely on one source, check them all!
1. F, Not all, some!

## Evaluate Journals for Open Science Processes

Form 3 groups and decide who will be the notetaker and who will share with the larger group. Each group is assigned 1 journal to review:

- Code4lib Journal: https://journal.code4lib.org/process-and-structure
- Practical Academic Librarianship: https://pal-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/pal/index
- International Journal on Digital Libraries: https://link.springer.com/journal/799/how-to-publish-with-us

Take 10 minutes and at the websites for these three journals and note how they integrate open science into 
their editorial and publishing processes. Use the below list to guide your notes:

1. How are articles made available to readers?
1. Are there any fees associated with publishing?
1. What is the peer review policy? 
1. Does the journal support linking to other research outputs? 

After 10 minutes, each group will share 1 thing that they learned and 1 thing that was difficult.
