- Discuss how open science values can affect the collaboration process of writing a scholarly article.

## Narrative Setup

An open–science–minded author is told their performance review depends on publishing in a peer-reviewed journal. They want to use GitHub to collaborate with coauthors transparently. This episode explores how the scholarly publishing process works and how open science values can be integrated.

## Overview of Scholarly Publishing

Researchers often face the "publish or perish" mandate. But what qualifies as "publishing"? And who decides what's acceptable?

Three stakeholder groups shape this:
1. Academic institutions (e.g., employers, tenure committees)
2. Funders (e.g., federal agencies)
3. Publishers (e.g., commercial or scholarly presses)

## OPTIONAL Exercise: Jargon Busting

Adapted from Library Carpentry: Have learners identify and explain publishing-related jargon in groups, then share out.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Conflicting Policies
Dr. Jay publishes in a hybrid journal that delays repository access beyond their funder's requirements. They must renegotiate or change journals.

### Case Study 2: Aligned Incentives
Dr. Ripken publishes in a fully open platform supported by institutional partnerships and funder mandates.

### Case Study 3: No Open Science Incentives
Dr. Brown chooses a closed journal based on personal networks and convenience, without considering long-term openness or access.

::::: discussion

## Discussion Exercise

- What could Dr. Jay have done differently at the project planning stage?
- If Dr. Ripken’s journal fees were too high, what would be their next step?
- Should Dr. Brown’s team explore more open options?
:::::: 


## Choosing a Publication Venue
- Use [Think. Check. Submit.](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) to assess journal credibility
- Check funder and institutional policies
- Evaluate a journal’s open science stance beyond JIFs

## Publishing Workflows

**Traditional Workflow**  
*Researchers → Peer Review → Edits → Publication → Library Access*

**Open Science Workflow**  
*Researchers → Preprints → Community Feedback → Submission → Open Peer Review → Open Access Publication*

## Exercise: Quiz – Traditional vs. Open Science Publishing
(T/F statements provided in source doc)

## Exercise: Journal Evaluation
Groups evaluate journals for openness using:
- Code4Lib Journal
- Practical Academic Librarianship
- International Journal on Digital Libraries

## Key Points
- Understand the institutional, funder, and publisher influences on publishing choices
- Assess publication venues critically for openness and accessibility
- Open science values can be embedded in authoring, publishing, and reviewing choices
