## Overview

This episode introduces the evolving concept of authorship in open science, focusing on the CRediT taxonomy for contributor roles and common issues surrounding conflicts of interest (COI). Learners will explore how authorship and transparency contribute to open and ethical research outputs.

::: objectives
- Understand author and contributor roles.
- Determine appropriate roles for given contributions.
- Explain common conflicts of interest and how to mitigate them.

## Authorship in the Open Science Era

What does it mean to author a paper? Is it just writing, or does it include data curation, software development, and conceptualization? Open science emphasizes transparency and inclusivity, broadening the definition of authorship to include many kinds of contributions.

Traditionally, authorship focused on writing and editing. However, in contemporary research, multiple individuals may contribute through diverse roles. The CRediT taxonomy helps make these roles visible and standardized.

### CRediT Taxonomy

In 2015, NISO released the **Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)**, identifying 14 specific contributor roles:

| Role                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Conceptualization    | Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims. |
| Data curation        | Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data. |
| Formal analysis      | Application of statistical, mathematical, computational techniques. |
| Funding acquisition  | Acquisition of financial support. |
| Investigation        | Conducting a research and investigation process. |
| Methodology          | Development or design of methodology; creation of models. |
| Project administration | Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution. |
| Resources            | Provision of study materials, reagents, patients, materials, computing resources. |
| Software             | Programming, software development; designing computer programs. |
| Supervision          | Oversight and leadership responsibility. |
| Validation           | Verification of results. |
| Visualization        | Preparation and presentation of data. |
| Writing – original draft | Preparation, creation of the published work. |
| Writing – review & editing | Critical review, commentary, or revision. |

Other definitions exist, such as [ICMJE's authorship guidelines](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html), but CRediT is particularly helpful for structured, machine-readable attribution.

## Exercises

::: challenge
**Exercise 1: Self-Reflection on Past Roles**

Describe the roles you have taken in prior publications. Can you map them to CRediT roles? Were there times you should have received authorship credit but did not?

**Exercise 2: Role Assignment Case Study**

Given a fictional research team and their contributions (provided by instructor), assign each team member one or more CRediT roles. Discuss whether they should be listed as authors.

## Conflict of Interest

Conflicts of Interest (COI) occur when personal or financial factors could bias, or appear to bias, an individual’s research or review responsibilities. These may be:

- **Financial:** Ties to funding bodies, companies, or products.
- **Non-financial:** Personal, professional, or ideological relationships.

Transparent disclosure is key to maintaining research integrity.

::: callout
## Conflict of Interest Statement (satirical example)
> The authors hope these results are correct because we all want to be cool people who are good at science.
:::

## Mitigating Conflicts

- Disclose potential COIs early and clearly.
- Use institutional or journal disclosure forms.
- Avoid reviewer assignments where relationships may bias judgment.

::: challenge
**Exercise 3: COI Quiz**

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

1. Financial COIs are the only ones that need to be disclosed.  
2. COIs can exist even if the influence is only perceived, not real.  
3. Authors should disclose close collaborations or personal relationships relevant to their work.  
4. Journals often have different requirements for COI disclosure.  

*Answers: F, T, T, T*

## Key Points

::: keypoints
- Authorship in open science includes more than writing; it encompasses many research roles.
- The CRediT taxonomy provides a transparent way to attribute contributions.
- Conflicts of interest can bias research and must be disclosed to maintain trust.
- Open science encourages structured authorship and transparency in conflicts.
