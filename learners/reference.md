**BibTeX**  
A reference management format used with LaTeX documents for citing and formatting bibliographies.

**CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)**  
A standardized taxonomy that defines 14 contributor roles (e.g., Conceptualization, Data Curation, Writing – Original Draft) to improve transparency in author contributions.

**DOI (Digital Object Identifier)**  
A persistent identifier used to uniquely identify electronic documents, such as journal articles or datasets.

**LaTeX**  
A typesetting system commonly used in academia for producing scientific and mathematical documents with high typographical quality.

**Markdown**  
A lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, often used for writing documents intended to be converted into HTML or PDF.

**Open Access**  
A publishing model that makes research outputs freely available online, removing access barriers for readers.

**Open Peer Review**  
A set of peer review practices that emphasize transparency, including revealing reviewer identities or publishing review reports.

**Open Science**  
A movement to make scientific research more accessible, transparent, reproducible, and inclusive through open data, open methods, open source tools, and open access publishing.

**Pandoc**  
An open-source tool that converts files from one markup format to another (e.g., Markdown to PDF or DOCX), commonly used in scholarly writing workflows.

**Preprint**  
A version of a scholarly paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a scientific journal. Often shared to solicit early feedback.

**RIS**  
A standardized tag format for citations, used to exchange bibliographic data between reference management tools.

**WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)**  
A user interface that allows authors to directly manipulate the layout of a document or webpage while editing.

**WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)**  
A document authoring approach that prioritizes semantic structure over visual appearance, enabling easier reuse, conversion, and machine readability.
